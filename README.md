this website is created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Mysql and PHP. It has a working login and registeration page. The contact us form also takes input from the user

The login page won't work until you make a database in the server such as Wamp Or Xammp. Make the tables using the information present in the users-table folder file for the login page to work properly.
